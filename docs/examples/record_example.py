# # Record variables
#
# This example demonstrates how to work with record input variables.
#
# A record variable is a product type. Record fields can be scalars,
# other record variables, or unions of such.
#
# MODFLOW 6 represents records as (possibly variadic) tuples. FloPy
# supports both a low-level tuple interface for records, conforming
# to MODFLOW 6, and a high-level, strongly-typed record interface.
#
# TODO flesh out
